If you're a first-time commiter, add yourself to the above list. This is not
just for legal reasons, but also to keep an overview of all those nicknames.

For some authors, the full names and/or e-mail addresses are unknown. They have
been marked by "?". Luckily, those author's contributions are only small typo
fixes, so no copyright concerns should arise from this.
If your info is missing, wrong, or you want it to be removed for whatever
reason, please contact us.

A full list of all openage-data authors ("contributors") can also be determined
from the VCS, e.g. via `git shortlog -sne`, or conveniently looked up on
[the GitHub web interface](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data/graphs/contributors).

Details on individual authorships of files can be obtained via the VCS,
e.g. via `git blame`, or the GitHub web interface.

If you wish to include a file from openage in your project, make sure to
include all required legal info. The easiest way to do this would probably
be to include a copy of this file (`copying.md`), and to leave the file's
copyright header untouched.

Per-file license header guidelines:

In addition to this file, to prevent legal caveats, every source file *must*
include a header.

**openage-native** source files, that is, files that were created by
_the openage authors_, require the following one-line header, preferrably in
the first line, as a comment:

    Copyright 20XX-20YY the openage authors. See copying.md for legal info.

`20XX` is the year when the file was created, and `20YY` is the year when the
file was last edited. When editing a file, make sure the last-modification year
is still correct.

The "license" line is required only if the file is not licensed as
"GPLv3 or higher".

Notes about this file:

I (mic_e) am not a lawyer. This is an open-source project, we're doing this for
fun. People convinced me that this legal shit must be done, so I did it, even
though I'd rather have spent the time on useful parts of the project.
If you see any legal issues, feel free to contact me.
I, personally, despise in-sourcefile legal text blocks. They're a pest,
and unlike many others, I don't simply accept them because
"that is what everybody does". Thus, I worked out the minimal 1-line text above,
which should be free of legal caveats, and a reasonable compromise.
I'd be happy to see it used in other projects; you're free to use this file
(`copying.md`) as a template for your project's legal documentation.
