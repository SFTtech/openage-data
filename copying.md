If you're a first-time commiter, add yourself to the above list. This is not
just for legal reasons, but also to keep an overview of all those nicknames.

If your info is missing, wrong, or you want it to be removed for whatever
reason, please [contact us](README.md#contact).

A full list of all openage-data authors ("contributors") can also be determined
from the VCS, e.g. via `git shortlog -sne`, or conveniently looked up on
[the GitHub web interface](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data/graphs/contributors).

Details on individual authorships of files can be obtained via the VCS,
e.g. via `git blame`, or the GitHub web interface.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License Version 3 for more details.

If you wish to include a file from the openage-data repository in your project,
make sure to include all required legal info. The easiest way to do this would probably
be to include a copy of this file (`copying.md`), and to leave the file's
copyright header untouched.

In addition to this file, to prevent legal caveats, every source file *must*
include a header.

**openage-data native** source files, that is, files that were created by
_the openage authors_ in this repo, require the following one-line header,
preferrably in the first line, as a comment:

    Copyright 20XX-20YY the openage authors. See copying.md for legal info.

`20XX` is the year when the file was created, and `20YY` is the year when the
file was last edited. When editing a file, make sure the last-modification year
is still correct.

Notes about this file:
It was initially designed for [openage](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/copying.md)
but has been adapted for the `openage-data` repository.
